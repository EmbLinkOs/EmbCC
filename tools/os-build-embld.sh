# os-build-embld.sh — cross-build the EmbLD linker itself INTO an EmbLinkOS
# binary (embld.elf) and stage it into the OS image tree.
#
# This is what makes the self-hosting loop close ON THE OS: with embld.elf on
# the image, the OS can compile its own compiler's 14 sources (embcc) AND link
# them into a runnable embcc — no host toolchain, no tcc, in the loop. Until
# now embld linked OS-targeted binaries but only while running on the host
# (gen-selfhost-ref.sh). Same linker, same inputs, run on the metal.
#
# Same safe direction as os-stage.sh (DECISIONS D-001): EmbCC reaches into the
# OS tree for the ABI objects and drops a finished .elf into build/. Nothing in
# EmbLinkOS reaches back.
#
#   usage: tools/os-build-embld.sh
#   env:   MYOS   path to the EmbLinkOS tree (default: ../myos)
#          CROSS  cross triple (default: x86_64-elf)
#
# After it stages build/embld.elf, rebuild the OS image (with EMBK_EMBCC_ROOT
# set so the sources+refs pack too) and boot: `test embld`, `test embcc self`,
# `test embcc selfhost`.
