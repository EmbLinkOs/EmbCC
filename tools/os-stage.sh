# os-stage.sh — build an EmbCC-compiled program FOR EmbLinkOS and stage it into
# the OS image, so the machine can judge it (ROADMAP M1's acceptance).
#
# This is the one place the two repositories touch, and it touches them in the
# safe direction: EmbCC reaches into the OS tree for the ABI objects and drops
# a finished .elf into its build/ staging area. Nothing in EmbLinkOS reaches
# back, so the OS still builds, boots, and passes its suite with this repo
# absent (DECISIONS D-001).
#
# What it does NOT do, on purpose: link. EmbCC has no linker yet (that is M3),
# so the cross toolchain's ld does the linking here — exactly the split
# ROADMAP M1 specifies ("linking is still done by the existing toolchain").
# Claiming otherwise would be the overclaim CONTRIBUTING exists to prevent.
#
#   usage: tools/os-stage.sh [source.c] [name]
#     source.c  program to compile   (default: tests/exec/exit42.c)
#     name      staged binary name   (default: embcc42)
#
#   env: MYOS  path to the EmbLinkOS tree (default: ../myos)
#
# Then, in the OS tree:
#     make STAGED_APPS=build/embcc42.elf
# naming the file so the image actually rebuilds — mkfs packs every build/*.elf
# it finds, but the OS's Makefile only rebuilds the image for prerequisites it
# was told about, and its drift guard exists precisely to catch this.
# It installs at /data/apps/<name>/<name>.elf. Boot, then at the debug console:
#     run /data/apps/embcc42/embcc42.elf
#     ps                      # the spawned pid's EXIT column
# Exit code 42 is M1. `run` does not wait, which is why the answer is read from
# ps rather than from run itself; the kernel's own `[syscall] exit code=0x2A`
# trace is the second, independent witness.
