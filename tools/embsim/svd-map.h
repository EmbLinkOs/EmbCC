/* svd-map.h -- a CMSIS-SVD file's peripherals as registers on the bus,
 * and the interface of the behavioural models layered over them.
 *
 * Every register of every peripheral the SVD describes (outside the
 * core's own private peripheral bus) is a word of storage with its reset
 * value, and an access to it does what the file says its fields do:
 * read-only, write-only, writeOnce; modifiedWriteValues (oneToClear and
 * the rest); readAction. An access where no register is, is a bus fault.
 * That is the register file (svd-map.c), and a peripheral without a model
 * is just that: its registers keep what is written, as the SVD allows.
 *
 * A model (stm32-rcc.c, stm32-gpio.c, ...) is a struct dev_ops over one
 * peripheral, picked by the board by the SVD's name for it. Its read and
 * write hooks get the program's accesses (`off` from the peripheral's
 * base) and pass them to rf_read and rf_write, the register file's, then
 * do what the hardware does: send the byte written to a data register,
 * set a ready bit, count. A change the hardware makes is rf_hw, which
 * --trace-periph shows as the hardware's. Its tick and next_event hooks
 * keep time as a device's do, while it says its clock runs (rf_clock).
 * docs/internals/embsim.md says how to add one. */
