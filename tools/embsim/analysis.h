/* analysis.h -- what EmbSim measures of a run beyond its counts: the
 * code it covered (coverage.c), where its time went (profile.c), how
 * deep its stacks went (stack.c), the faults it took (fault.c), and the
 * record of its inputs that replays it (record.c).
 *
 * All of them watch the run one step at a time through an_step, which
 * the run loop calls in place of the core's step when any is on, so a
 * run with none of them is the loop it always was. an_step notes the pc
 * and the counts before the step and, after it, gives each analysis the
 * instruction that ran and what it cost; and it follows the program's
 * calls and returns, as the core executes them, on a shadow stack of
 * frames (the profile's call paths, a function's frame size, the
 * backtrace when there is no CFI). The cores tell it of exception entry
 * and return (an_exc_entry, an_exc_return), which no instruction shows. */
