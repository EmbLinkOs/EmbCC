/* Minimal DWARF line-info emitter (D-010 step 1: "where am I?" —
 * address <-> source file:line, the cheapest debug layer that buys the
 * largest fraction of a debugger's usefulness).
 *
 * Emits three sections from the codegen line table (ir_func.lines):
 *   .debug_abbrev  one compile_unit abbreviation
 *   .debug_info    one CU DIE (producer/name/comp_dir/low_pc/high_pc/stmt_list)
 *   .debug_line    a DWARF-4 line-number program, one row where the line
 *                  changes, bracketed per function by set_address/end_sequence
 * DWARF version 4, 32-bit format, address_size 8. No .debug_info children
 * (subprogram/local DIEs are step 2); backtraces still name functions from
 * the ELF .symtab, and line breakpoints need only the line table + CU.
 *
 * The addresses are RELOCATED: the object is ET_REL, so every field holding
 * a .text address (line-program set_address, CU low/high_pc) and every field
 * holding a debug-section offset (CU abbrev_offset, stmt_list) is written as
 * zero and paired with a relocation the driver hands to the ELF writer. The
 * emitter has no ELF dependency — it returns the reloc list; the driver maps
 * targets to section symbols. */
