/* The type representation — the single most load-bearing structure in
 * the compiler (every phase downstream takes its shape from it).
 *
 * Types I scope: void, the integer types char/short/int/long with
 * unsigned variants, and pointers. LP64 throughout (TARGET_ABI): long
 * and pointers are 8 bytes. Arrays, structs, enums, and function types
 * are later M2 increments — code that would need them must refuse.
 *
 * Value representation contract (codegen relies on it): expression
 * temporaries always hold PROMOTED values — 32-bit class for
 * char/short/int (C's integer promotions do this anyway) or 64-bit
 * class for long/pointers. Only variables in memory have the narrow
 * widths; loads extend, stores truncate.
