# Run a QEMU command with a hard timeout, portably.
#
# macOS ships no coreutils `timeout`, and `perl -e alarm; exec` does not
# work here: QEMU installs its own SIGALRM handler, so the alarm is
# swallowed and a hung guest hangs the whole suite. Backgrounding and
# killing is the only reliable form.
#
# The watchdog must not keep the CALLER's stdout open: a caller that captures
# the guest's output with $(...) waits for every holder of that pipe to close
# it, and an orphaned `sleep` would make every run take the full timeout. So
# the watchdog's own stdio is /dev/null, and stopping it stops its sleep.
#
# usage: qrun.sh <seconds> <command> [args...]   -> the guest's exit status
