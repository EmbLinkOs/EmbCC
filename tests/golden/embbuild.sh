# M4, the host half: EmbCC's build expressed as an EmbBuild manifest, and that
# manifest actually building EmbCC. ROADMAP M4 is "EmbLinkOS builds EmbCC, with
# EmbBuild, from /data/src" — the total loop. EmbBuild (myos docs/BUILD.md) and
# the on-OS self-host already exist; the missing artifact was the manifest, and
# hand-writing its header closures is the staleness trap BUILD.md 6 warns of.
#
# This proves the generated manifest is correct and complete by WALKING it with
# a host reference EmbBuild (tools/embbuild-run.sh) — the same walk the OS's
# EmbBuild performs, mapped onto the host tree — and checking it yields a
# well-formed, fully-resolved embcc.elf. Running that binary is on-OS only (it
# links against newlib for the EmbLink syscall ABI), exactly like the self-host
# stage1. Skips honestly when the OS runtime / newlib are not on this host.
