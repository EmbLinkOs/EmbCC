# made and its kernel loads (myos/build/*.embx).
#
# Two halves, and the second is the one that matters: an image the
# kernel accepts must pass every guard, and a CORRUPTED image must be
# refused at the right step. A verifier that only ever says yes has
# verified nothing (CONTRIBUTING: a green test that cannot fail is a
# lie waiting to happen).
#
# Skips honestly when the OS tree is not on this machine; the
# not-an-EMBX case always runs, because it needs no fixture.
