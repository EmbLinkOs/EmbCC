# B1 — EmbLD links the M1 program against the REAL EmbLinkOS runtime:
# crt0.o + syscalls.o + an EmbCC-compiled object + newlib's libc.a, into
# an ET_EXEC. This is the WORKPLAN stream-B first milestone.
#
# The functional acceptance (the binary exits 42 under the kernel) is an
# on-OS step, confirmed by hand the way M1 and M2 were — the OS is the
# final judge, not the gatekeeper of every commit (DECISIONS D-005). What
# this test does on every run is the host half: the link SUCCEEDS (every
# symbol closed against real libc.a, archive members pulled to a fixed
# point), and the result is structurally what the loader binds — checked
# against cross-ld from the identical inputs.
#
# Skips honestly when the OS tree / newlib are not on this machine.
