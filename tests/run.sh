# Test runner (ARCHITECTURE.md §7).
#
#   usage: tests/run.sh [--target=x86_64-elf|aarch64-elf]
#
# Two kinds of test:
#   *.sh under tests/{exec,compile,golden}/ — run with $EMBCC set; passes
#     when it exits 0 AND its output contains "TEST-MARKER <name>". The
#     marker catches CONTRIBUTING's lie #2 (a test that silently never
#     ran).
#   *.c under tests/exec/ — compiled by embcc and RUN; the exit code must
#     equal the '// expect-exit: N' line in the file. These are the tests
#     that count: they assert the machine ran what we emitted. Artifacts
#     are rebuilt from scratch every run (lie #1: the stale binary).
#
# How "RUN" happens depends on the target, and neither route is the host:
#
#   x86_64-elf   linked with the host cc and executed directly. This only
#                works where the host IS the target — a Linux x86-64 box.
#   aarch64-elf  linked into a bare-metal image against the cross newlib
#                and executed under qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt, with ARM
#                semihosting carrying stdout and the exit status back out
#                (tests/harness/aarch64/).
#
# The aarch64 route is the honest one on a machine that is neither: it
# runs the code on the architecture it was compiled for, on the same
# QEMU virt machine EmbLinkOS itself targets.
