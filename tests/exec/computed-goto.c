 * else, except for the passes that put an instruction ON AN EDGE: there is no
 * block between `goto *p` and its target to put one in. Codegen still keeps
 * these functions in the memory model (no regalloc, no slot coalescing), so
 * `keep` below, live ACROSS the indirect jumps, must survive. Refereed against
