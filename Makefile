# EmbCC — host build (ROADMAP M0: EmbCC is a host program at this stage).

# (ROADMAP M4), so nothing here may grow host-only cleverness the manifest
# could not express.

# implement (ARCHITECTURE.md §7). Keep it buildable by a strict C99 compiler.

# embls — the language server (docs/manual/diagnostics.md T5). It links EmbCC's own
